# Conditional Expressions

Decision making is required when we want to execute a code only if a certain condition is satisfied. The if...elif...else statement is used in Python for decision making. If-else conditional statement is used in when a situation leads to **two conditions** and **one of them should hold true**.

## If else Statement Syntax

```{python}
x=1
if x==1:
    print("x is 1") # this is body of if or statement
#else:
 #   print("x is not 1") # this is body of elif
```

Here, the program evaluates the `test expression` and will execute statement(s) only if the test expression is `True`. If the test expression is `False`, the statement(s) is not executed.

In Python, the body of the `if` statement is indicated by the **indentation**. The body starts with an indentation and the first unindented line marks the end.

Remember: Python interprets non-zero values as `True`. `None` and `0` are interpreted as `False`.

## Indentation

Python uses **indentation** for blocks, instead of curly braces. Both **tabs and spaces** are supported, but the standard indentation requires standard Python code to **use four spaces**. For example:

```{python}
x=1
if x==1:
    #indented four spaces
    print("x is 1")
else:
    print("x is not 1")
```

If statement, without indentation (will raise an error).

## If elif and else Statement

```{python}
x=-1
if x==1:
    #indented four spaces
    print("x is 1") # this is body of if or statement
elif x<0:
  print("x is less than zero")
else:
    print("x is not 1") # this is body of elif
```

### Example

Write a program to print 'Yes' when the number entered by the user is greater than or equal to 25.

```{python, error=TRUE, include=TRUE}
#n = int(input(" Please enter the number: "))
n=32
if n>=25:
  print("Yes")
else:
  print("No")
```

Write a program to check if a number entered by the user is positive or negative or zero and display an appropriate message.

```{python}
#n = int(input(" Please enter the number: "))
n = -4
if n>0:
  print("Number is +ve")
elif n==0:
  print("Number is zero")
else:
  print("Number is -ve")
```

we use if elif and else statement ***if one of the statement is true***.

## Nested if statements

We can have a `if...elif...else` statement inside another `if...elif...else` statement. This is called **nesting** in computer programming.

Any number of these statements can be nested inside one another. Indentation is the only way to figure out the level of nesting. They can get confusing, so they must be avoided unless necessary.

Example: Write a program to check if a number entered by the user is positive or negative or zero and display an appropriate message using nested if statement.

```{python}
#n = int(input(" Please enter the number: "))
n = 3
if n>=0:
  if n==0:
    print("Number is zero")
  else:
    print("Number is +ve")
else:
  print("Number is -ve")
```

### Note:

-   There can any number of elif statements.

-   last else will be executed if all elif conditions/statements fails.

## Multiple If Conditions

### Example

Write a program to print largest number among four numbers entered by the user.

```{python}
n1 = 4 #n1 = int(input(" Enter the First Number : "))
n2 = 3 #n2 = int(input(" Enter the 2nd  Number : "))
n3 = 2 #n3 = int(input(" Enter the 3rd Number : "))
n4 = 1 #n4 = int(input(" Enter the 4th Number : "))

if n1>n2:
    f1 = n1
else:
   f1 = n2
if n3>n4:
   f2 = n3
else:
    f2 = n4
if f1>f2:
    print(f" The Largest Number is : {f1} ")
else:
    print(f" The Largest Number is : {f2} ")

```
