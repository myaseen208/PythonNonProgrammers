# Python Dictionaries and Sets

## Dictionaries

Like a real-life dictionary has **words** and **meanings**, Python dictionaries have **keys** and **values**. Dictionaries in Python are collections that are *unordered*, i*ndexed and mutable*. They hold keys and values.

They are in *curly brackets*. Key-value pairs are **separated by commas** and *keys and values* are **separated by colons**. Keys in dictionaries are *unique* and *immutable*. You can search for a value *if you know the key*. **One key cannot have two values**.

```{python}
Financial_Dictionary = {"Key": "Value", "Key": "Value1", "SBP" : "State Bank of Pakistab", "BSC" : "Banking Services Corporation", "PSPC" : "Pakistan Security Printing Corporation", "NIBAF" : "National Institute of Banking and Finance", 'Marks' : [71, 78, 84]}
print(type(Financial_Dictionary))
print(Financial_Dictionary)
print(Financial_Dictionary['Marks'])
del(Financial_Dictionary['BSC']) # will del key=BSC
print(Financial_Dictionary)
print('BSC' in Financial_Dictionary) # as it already deleted , Results in False
```

## Nested Dictionaries and Dictionary Methods

```{python, error=TRUE, include=TRUE}
Dict = {'1' : 'One', '2':'Two', "Dict1" : {'3': 'Three', '4' : 'Four'} }
print(Dict['1'])
print(Dict['Dict1']['4'])
Dict['1'] = 'i' # Immutable i.e. we can change 
print(Dict)
print(Dict.keys()) # will show the keys of a dictionary
print(Dict.values()) #will show the value of a dictionary
print(Dict.items()) # print the (key : value) for all contents of Dictionary
new_dict = {'Hello' : 'World'}
Dict.update(new_dict) # will append new_dict in Dict
print(Dict)
print(Dict['9']) # returns error if not in Dict
print(Dict.get('9')) # return None
```

```{python}
# Phone = input ("Number Please: ")
phone = "123"
Digit_Dict = {
    "1" : "One",
    "2" : "Two",
    "3" : "Three",
    "4" : "Four"
}
output = ""
for numbers in phone:
    output += Digit_Dict.get(numbers, "!") + " "
print(output)
```

Quick Quiz: Get a message from input method and resturn the same message with translated emoji like ":)" to ðŸ˜Š.

```{python}
#message = input(">")
message = "I am happy :)"
words = message.split()
# print(words)
emoji_dict = {
     ":)" : "ðŸ˜Š",
     ":(" : "ðŸ˜’"
 }
trans_message = "" 
for word in words:
    trans_message += emoji_dict.get(word, word)+ " "
print(trans_message)

```

## Sets

Sets in Python are a collection of unordered and unindexed Python objects. Sets are mutable, iterable and they do not contain duplicate values. It is similar to the concept of the mathematical set. That is, set is a collection of non-repetitive elements. The elements in a set are declared inside curly braces separated by commas.

```{python}
a = {2,1,3,4,2,5,6,3,8}
type(a)
print(a)
b = {}  # check the type of a
c = set() # an empty set
type(c)
c.add (2)
c.add (5)
print(c)

```

Since the sets are *unindexed*, we *cannot use slicing or indexing* on sets, it will give us a TypeError error when using indexing.

### Properties of Sets

-   Sets are Unordered

-   Sets are Unindexed

-   There is no way to change items in a set

-   Sets can't contain duplicate values

## Operations on Sets

+---------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Col1                            | Col2                                                                                                                                                      |
+=================================+===========================================================================================================================================================+
| set.add( n)                     | The add() function in python sets takes the value as an argument which we want to add to our set and adds the element in our set. one element at a time   |
+---------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| set. remove ( m )               | The function deletes the specified element from the set and if the element is not present in the set, it does not return any error.                       |
+---------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| set. pop ( )                    | pop() function doesn't take any argument and it removes an arbitrary element from the set and also returns the deleted element.                           |
+---------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| set. clear( )                   | The clear() function empties the set. It can also be used for dictionaries.                                                                               |
+---------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| set.update( )                   | The update() function in python sets can be used to add multiple values to the set at once. It takes an iterable like lists, set or tuple as an argument. |
+---------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| set.union ({4,5})               | Return a new set with all item from both sets                                                                                                             |

25. Provide a use case for each of the following Python data structures: tuple, list, and dictionary.Â  Explain why each use case is appropriate for each data structure as opposed to the others.

    List - A shopping list. The list type is appropriate, since it can be changed.

    Tuple - The first 7 prime numbers. A tuple is a suitable structure, because it is a immutable data type.

    Dictionary - A list of words and their meanings. Since a dictionary is made up by key-value pairs, the key would be the word and the value would assume it's meaning.

    Set - A list of registered e-mails in a system. It's a proper way to store them, for the e-mails must each be unique.

26. Ask the phone number from a user, and convert integers into strings like: 1 to one.
